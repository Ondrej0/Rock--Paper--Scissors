# Rock--Paper--Scissors

This project was my first way off experimenting with random numbers in javascript. It was very exciting to see my js code for the first work with html
and css. Even though the code could do with some cleaning up I'm still happy with how it turned out especially because I did not allow my self to look at any tutorials
or code online relating to the logic.
